We are going to store all of our contracts in the src directory.
Test is where we'll put code to test what's in src 
script is where we'll put code that interacts with our contract in src.
foundry.toml let's us update config for foundry.

We are turning on FormatOnSave to format as we go automatically in the vs code settings.
use >format to format your code
in the "out" directory, is a json file with all of the metadata about a transaction including ABI
In Remix, we often deployed code to a remix VM. To do it in foundry:
Begin a local evm environment deployment by using the anvil command in the terminal.

Next let's study injecting a web3 provider. We're going to add the locally running anvil network to a browser metamask.
Get the network info from anvil, open metamask then add custom network.
Next in metamask you need to import account with the private key given by anvil

Now, to deploy contracts from forge:
in the terminal, type forge create SimpleStorage --interactive
Never use a private key in vscode, which might send data. If you need to deploy something with a private key, use your own bash terminal.
